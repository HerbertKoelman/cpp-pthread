  "body": "# what it does\r\n\r\nIBM's compiler is not implementing all the features of C++11 standard, especially it's laking the concurrency features that the standard brings.\r\n\r\nThis wrapper intends to bring these feature by wrapping the pthread library.  Of course, as it is a replacement of C++11 features, it is best to use the standard implementation if your compiler support it.\r\n\r\nTo use this library:\r\n```\r\nconfigure\r\nmake\r\nmake install\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstall moves files into your system's default localtion of headers and libraries (often /usr/local/include and /usr/local/lib). Use this command to change target directory:\r\n```\r\nconfigure --prefix=/usr/local\r\n```\r\n\r\nMore [here](https://github.com/HerbertKoelman/cpp-pthread/wiki)\r\n",
