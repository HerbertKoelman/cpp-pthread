  "body": "# What it does\r\n\r\nIBM's compiler is not implementing all the features of C++11 standard, especially it's lacking the concurrency features that the standard brings. This will at some point be fixed and was therfore looking at a way reduce the effort to switch from a specific implementation to the C++11 standard one. This projetc is the resulting code.\r\n\r\nThis wrapper intends to bring these feature by implementing C++11 interface and using the  pthread library.  Of course, as it is a replacement of C++11 features, it is best to use the standard implementation if your compiler support it. This can be done rather easely by using the standard namespace `std` instead of this library's specific one `pthread`.\r\n\r\nTo use this library:\r\n```\r\nconfigure\r\nmake\r\nmake install\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstall moves files into your system's default localtion of headers and libraries (often /usr/local/include and /usr/local/lib). Use this command to change target directory:\r\n```\r\nconfigure --prefix=/usr/local\r\n```\r\n\r\n[Documentation](http://herbertkoelman.github.io/cpp-pthread/doc/html/) can be generated with this command:\r\n```\r\nmake doxygen\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis command creates a `doc` directory wich will contain the generated documentation.\r\n\r\n> **warning** generating documentation requires that doxygen is installed.\r\n\r\n# How to use it\r\n\r\nOnce compiled and installed in a location that suites you, use your compiler options to reference the headers and the libraries directory. In almoast all casses you can:\r\n* include `#include \"pthread/phtread.hpp\"` in your code.\r\n* comment the c++11 standard includes in your code\r\n* declare that you're now using the namespace pthread (`using namespace pthread ;`)\r\n\r\nIt should now compile use this very simple (but often good enough) implementation.\r\n\r\n# Usefull links\r\n\r\n* [documentation](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/threads.html) of the underlying POSIX threading library \r\n* [project's home](https://github.com/HerbertKoelman/cpp-pthread)\r\n* [project's doxygen](http://herbertkoelman.github.io/cpp-pthread/doc/html/)\r\n* [std::thread](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/thread) implementation we try to mimic\r\n* [std::lock_guard](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/lock_guard/lock_guard)  implementation we try to mimic \r\n* [std::mutex](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/mutex) implementation we try to mimic\r\n* [std::condition_variable](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/condition_variable) implementation we try to mimic\r\n\r\nMore [here](https://github.com/HerbertKoelman/cpp-pthread/wiki)\r\n\r\n# misc\r\n\r\n* author herbert koelman\r\n* github [cpp-pthread](https://github.com/HerbertKoelman/cpp-pthread)\r\n",
