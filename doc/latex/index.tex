Some C/\+C++ compilers are not implementing all of C++11 and above standard, it\textquotesingle{}s often lacking the concurrency features that the standard brings. These compilers will at some point be fixed and we were therefore looking at a way to reduce the effort of switching from a specific implementation to the C++11 standard one.

This projetc is the resulting code.

Of course, this library is a replacement of C++11 features, it is best to use the standard implementation if your compiler support it.

To use this library\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 configure
2 make
3 make install
\end{DoxyCode}


Install moves files into your system\textquotesingle{}s default localtion for headers and libraries (often /usr/local/include and /usr/local/lib). Use this command to change install target directory\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 configure --prefix=/usr/local
\end{DoxyCode}


\href{http://herbertkoelman.github.io/cpp-pthread/doc/html/}{\tt Doxygen documentation} can be generated with this command. I hope this help make things easier to use and understand. 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 make doxygen
\end{DoxyCode}

The {\ttfamily make} target {\ttfamily pkg} will produce au tar.\+gz that can be distributed.

\subsubsection*{How to use it}

Once compiled and installed in a location that suites you, use your compiler options to reference the headers and the library directory. In almoast all casses you can\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item include {\ttfamily \#include \char`\"{}pthread/phtread.\+hpp\char`\"{}} in your code to replace of the standard includes.
\item comment out or the c++11 standard includes in your code
\item replace {\ttfamily std} namespace with {\ttfamily pthread} ( std\+::condition\+\_\+variable becomes \hyperlink{classpthread_1_1condition__variable}{pthread\+::condition\+\_\+variable}, etc)
\end{DoxyItemize}

Sample code can be found in the {\ttfamily tests} directory. To use it, run the following commands\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 cd tests
2 ./configure
3 ./make
\end{DoxyCode}

\paragraph*{Memory management on A\+IX}

Memory management on A\+IX is quite sophisticated making it possible to fine tuned very precisely the way your program uses memory. Consider using these compiler/linker options when using pthreads\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item -\/bmaxdata\+:0x\+N0000000 this option activates the large memory model, N is a number in the range of \mbox{[}1-\/8\mbox{]}.
\item -\/bmaxmem=-\/1 this option tell the compiler to use as much memory it needs (usefull when -\/O option is used).
\end{DoxyItemize}

Thread stack size\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 32bits programs allocate 96\+KB per thread on the program\textquotesingle{}s heap.
\item 64bits programs allocate 192\+KB per thread on the program\textquotesingle{}s heap.
\end{DoxyItemize}

On many Linux implementations and on Mac OS X the stack size is defaulted to 8\+MB. You may consider setting this as a default.
