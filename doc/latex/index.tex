I\+BM\textquotesingle{}s compiler is not implementing all the features of C++11 standard, especially it\textquotesingle{}s lacking the concurrency features that the standard brings. This will at some point be fixed and was therfore looking at a way reduce the effort to switch from a specific implementation to the C++11 standard one. This projetc is the resulting code.

This wrapper intends to bring these feature by implementing C++11 interface and using the pthread library. Of course, as it is a replacement of C++11 features, it is best to use the standard implementation if your compiler support it. This can be done rather easely by using the standard namespace {\ttfamily std} instead of this library\textquotesingle{}s specific one {\ttfamily pthread}.

To use this library\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 configure
2 make
3 make install
\end{DoxyCode}


Install moves files into your system\textquotesingle{}s default localtion of headers and libraries (often /usr/local/include and /usr/local/lib). Use this command to change target directory\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 configure --prefix=/usr/local
\end{DoxyCode}


\href{http://herbertkoelman.github.io/cpp-pthread/doc/html/}{\tt Doxygen documentation} can be generated with this command. I hope this help make things easier to use and understand. 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 make doxygen
\end{DoxyCode}

The {\ttfamily make} target {\ttfamily pkg} will produce au tar.\+gz that can be distributed.

\subsubsection*{How to use it}

Once compiled and installed in a location that suites you, use your compiler options to reference the headers and the library directory. In almoast all casses you can\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item include {\ttfamily \#include \char`\"{}pthread/phtread.\+hpp\char`\"{}} in your code.
\item comment the c++11 standard includes in your code
\item declare that you\textquotesingle{}re now using the namespace pthread ({\ttfamily using namespace pthread ;})
\end{DoxyItemize}

Sample code can be found in the {\ttfamily tests} directory. To use it, run the following commands\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 cd tests
2 ./configure
3 ./make
\end{DoxyCode}
