I\+BM\textquotesingle{}s compiler is not implementing all the features of C++11 standard, especially it\textquotesingle{}s lacking the concurrency features that the standard brings. This will at some point be fixed and was therfore looking at a way reduce the effort to switch from a specific implementation to the C++11 standard one. This projetc is the resulting code.

This wrapper intends to bring these feature by implementing C++11 interface and using the pthread library. Of course, as it is a replacement of C++11 features, it is best to use the standard implementation if your compiler support it. This can be done rather easely by using the standard namespace {\ttfamily std} instead of this library\textquotesingle{}s specific one {\ttfamily pthread}.\+:w

To use this library\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 configure
2 make
3 make install
\end{DoxyCode}


Install moves files into your system\textquotesingle{}s default localtion of headers and libraries (often /usr/local/include and /usr/local/lib). Use this command to change target directory\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 configure --prefix=/usr/local
\end{DoxyCode}


\href{http://herbertkoelman.github.io/cpp-pthread/doc/html/}{\tt Documentation} can be generated with this command\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 make doxygen
2 ...
\end{DoxyCode}


This command creates a {\ttfamily doc} directory wich will contain the generated documentation.

\begin{quote}
{\bfseries warning} generating documentation requires that doxygen is installed. \end{quote}


\section*{How to use it}

Once compiled and installed in a location that suites you, use your compiler options to reference the headers and the libraries directory. In almoast all casses you can\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item include {\ttfamily \#include \char`\"{}pthread/phtread.\+hpp\char`\"{}} in your code.
\item comment the c++11 standard includes in your code
\item declare that you\textquotesingle{}re now using the namespace pthread ({\ttfamily using namespace pthread ;})
\end{DoxyItemize}

It should now compile use this very simple (but often good enough) implementation.
