# cpp-pthread

IBM's compiler is not implement all the features of C++11 standard, especially it laking the concurrency features that the standard brings. This wrapper intends to bring these feature by
wrapping the pthread library.

To use this libray:
```
configure
make
make install
```

Of course as it is a replacement of C++11 features it is best to use the standard implementation if your compiler implments it.
