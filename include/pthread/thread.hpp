     using the thread attributes object specified by the attr parameter. The new
     thread inherits its creating thread's signal mask; but any pending signal of the
     creating thread will be cleared for the new thread.
     
     The new thread is made runnable, and will start executing the run routine, with.
     
     After thread creation, the thread attributes object can be reused to create
     another thread, or deleted.
     
     The thread terminates in the following cases:
     
     o The thread returned from its starting routine (the main routine for the initial thread)
     o The thread called the pthread_exit subroutine
     o The thread was canceled
     o The thread received a signal that terminated it
     o The entire process is terminated due to a call to either the exec or exit subroutines.
     
     Note: The pthread.h header file must be the first included file of each
     source file using the threads library. Otherwise, the -D_thread_SAFE
     compilation flag should be used, or the cc_r compiler used. In this case,
     the flag is automatically set.
     
     When multiple threads are created in a process, the FULL_CORE flag is set for all
     signals. This means that if a core file is produced, it will be much bigger than
     a single_threaded application. This is necessary to debug multiple-threaded
     processes.

     returns immediately. It is impossible to join a detached thread, even if it is
     not yet terminated. The target thread is automatically detached after all joined
